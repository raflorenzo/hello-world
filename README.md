Re-learning git
- The master is the truth
- Creating a branch takes a copy of the master at that point in time
- If someone else made changes to the master while I was working on a branch, I could pull in the changes.
- Saved changes are called commits. Each commit is associated with a commit message, explaining the reason for the change.
